# ConvoETL Analytics Documentation

## Overview
ConvoETL provides comprehensive analytics capabilities divided into two tiers:
- **Generic Analytics**: Statistical and aggregated metrics using traditional data analysis

- Build incremental computation capabilities

### Phase 2: Advanced Analytics (LLM Integration)
- Integrate with OpenAI/Anthropic/Local LLMs
- Implement batching for cost efficiency
- Create prompt templates for different analyses
- Build caching layer for LLM results

### Phase 3: Real-time Analytics
- Implement streaming analytics for live data
- Create alert system for anomalies
- Build dashboard for monitoring
- Enable custom metric definitions
