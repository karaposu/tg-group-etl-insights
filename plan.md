# Telegram ETL Implementation Plan

## Overview
Three progressive versions of the TelegramETL module, each building on the previous with increased scalability and production readiness.

---

## Version 1: All Local with SQLite

### Architecture
**Single machine deployment with local database**

### Components

#### 1. TelegramETL Module
- **Core Responsibility**: Extract messages from Telegram groups using tgdata package
- **Storage**: SQLite database on local filesystem
- **Scheduling**: Local scheduler (cron or Python scheduler like APScheduler)

#### 2. Data Flow
- **Initial Backfill**:
  - Connect to Telegram via tgdata
  - Fetch all historical messages for the configured group
  - Store raw messages in SQLite with minimal processing
  - Track highest message_id per group for incremental updates

- **Incremental Updates**:
  - Poll every 5-15 minutes for new messages
  - Query SQLite for the last processed message_id
  - Fetch only messages after that ID using tgdata's after_id parameter
  - Append new messages to SQLite

#### 3. Analysis Pipeline
- **Trigger Mechanism**: SQLite triggers or periodic job that checks for unprocessed messages
- **Processing**:
  - Batch processing of new messages (e.g., every 100 messages or every hour)
  - Entity extraction (hashtags, mentions, URLs) using regex
  - Word/character counting
  - User statistics aggregation
  - Results stored in analysis tables within same SQLite database

#### 4. Advantages
- Simple setup, no cloud dependencies
- Fast local queries
- Easy debugging and development
- No network latency
- Zero infrastructure costs

#### 5. Limitations
- **Single point of failure**: If your laptop crashes, ETL stops
- **RAM constraints**: Can't load 1M messages into pandas DataFrame (needs ~8GB RAM)
- **CPU bottlenecks**: Sentiment analysis on 100k messages could take hours on laptop
- **Storage limits**: 500GB of messages would fill most laptop drives
- **No parallel processing**: Can't analyze multiple groups simultaneously
- **Manual backup management**: Need to manually copy SQLite files for backup
- **Query performance**: Complex JOINs on millions of rows could take minutes in SQLite

## Version 2: Local Execution with BigQuery Storage

### Architecture
**Hybrid approach: Local extraction, cloud storage**

### Components

#### 1. TelegramETL Module (Local)
- **Core Responsibility**: Same extraction logic as Version 1
- **Storage**: Google BigQuery instead of SQLite
- **Authentication**: Service account credentials for BigQuery access

#### 2. Data Flow
- **Initial Backfill**:
  - Extract messages using tgdata locally
  - Stream batches directly to BigQuery using pandas-gbq
  - Utilize BigQuery's streaming inserts for real-time loading
  - Leverage BigQuery's built-in deduplication

- **Incremental Updates**:
  - Query BigQuery for MAX(message_id) instead of local state
  - Fetch new messages locally
  - Stream to BigQuery tables (partitioned by date for cost optimization)

#### 3. Analysis Pipeline
- **BigQuery Native Processing**:
  - **Window Functions**: Calculate running totals, rank users by activity, find message trends over time
    - Example: Rank users by messages per day, identify most active hours per user
  - **Array/Struct Operations**: Process JSON fields, extract hashtags, analyze entity patterns
    - Example: UNNEST arrays of mentions to find most mentioned users
  - **ML.GENERATE_TEXT**: Use Gemini Pro directly in SQL for content generation
    - Example: `SELECT ML.GENERATE_TEXT(MODEL 'gemini-pro', prompt: CONCAT('Summarize these messages: ', STRING_AGG(message_text)))` 
    - Generate daily summaries, extract topics, classify content, all in SQL
  - **ML.UNDERSTAND_TEXT**: Entity extraction, sentiment, content classification
    - Example: `SELECT message_id, ML.UNDERSTAND_TEXT(message_text, 'SENTIMENT') as sentiment_score`
    - No external API needed, runs entirely in BigQuery
  - **ML.TRANSLATE**: Translate messages to analyze multi-language groups
  - **BQML Custom Models**: Train clustering models to identify user types
    - Example: `CREATE MODEL user_segments OPTIONS(model_type='kmeans') AS SELECT user_id, avg_message_length, messages_per_day...`
  - **Time-Series Analysis**: LAG/LEAD functions for message reply patterns, response times
    - Example: Average time between user messages, conversation flow analysis
  - **Massive Joins**: Cross-reference millions of messages with user data instantly
    - Example: Join all messages with user profiles without memory constraints
  - **Scheduled Queries**: Automatic daily/hourly aggregations that run in the cloud
    - Example: Daily active users, hourly message counts, auto-updating dashboards

- **Optional Python Analysis** (might not even be needed!):
  - Custom visualization if BigQuery + Looker isn't enough
  - Specialized NLP libraries not available in BigQuery
  - Integration with external services
  - Complex graph analysis of user interactions

#### 3.1 Example: Complete Analysis in BigQuery SQL (No Python Needed!)

**Daily Summary Generation:**
- Use `ML.GENERATE_TEXT` with Gemini Pro to summarize daily conversations
- Extract topics, identify key discussions, all in SQL
- Cost: ~$0.125 per 1M characters with Gemini Pro

**User Profiling:**
- Analyze communication patterns using window functions
- Generate personality insights with `ML.GENERATE_TEXT`
- Cluster users into segments with BQML K-means

**Sentiment & Entity Analysis:**
- `ML.UNDERSTAND_TEXT` for sentiment scores on every message
- Extract entities (people, places, organizations) automatically
- No external API calls, no rate limits

**Real Example Query:**
```sql
-- Generate daily insights completely in BigQuery
WITH daily_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE(date) as day,
    COUNT(*) as message_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users,
    STRING_AGG(message_text, ' ' LIMIT 10000) as sample_messages
  FROM messages
  WHERE group_id = @group_id 
    AND DATE(date) = CURRENT_DATE()
  GROUP BY DATE(date)
)
SELECT 
  day,
  message_count,
  active_users,
  ML.GENERATE_TEXT(
    MODEL `project.dataset.gemini_model`,
    CONCAT(
      'Analyze this Telegram group conversation. ',
      'Message count: ', CAST(message_count AS STRING), '. ',
      'Active users: ', CAST(active_users AS STRING), '. ',
      'Sample messages: ', sample_messages, '. ',
      'Provide: 1) Main topics discussed, 2) Overall sentiment, 3) Key insights'
    )
  ).ml_generate_text_result AS daily_analysis
FROM daily_stats;
```

This completely eliminates the need for a separate Python analysis pipeline!

#### 4. Advantages
- **Unlimited storage capacity**: Store years of messages without worrying about disk space
- **Process millions of messages in seconds**: BigQuery can scan TB of data faster than SQLite can scan GB
- **No memory limits**: Analyze all messages at once, not in chunks
- **Built-in ML capabilities**: 
  - BQML for clustering users, predicting activity patterns
  - Text analysis functions for sentiment without external APIs
- **Automatic optimization**: BigQuery handles indexing, partitioning, caching automatically
- **Real-time dashboards**: Connect Looker/Tableau directly to BigQuery
- **Cost effective at scale**: $0.02/GB storage, $5/TB queried vs managing your own servers

#### 5. Considerations
- Requires internet connection
- BigQuery costs for storage and queries
- Network latency for read/write operations
- Need to manage GCP credentials locally
