# Project Philosophy

## Core Principles

### 1. User-Centric Data Model
Every piece of data is attributed to individual users. We build from the user up, ensuring that:
- Each message is linked to its author
- User profiles are first-class entities
- Analytics can drill down to individual behavior
- Future user profiling and demographics are supported

### 2. Data Integrity First
Every message extracted must be accurately preserved and processed. We prioritize data completeness and accuracy over processing speed. No data should be lost or corrupted during the ETL process.

### 3. Modular Architecture
Each component (Extract, Transform, Load, Insights) operates independently with well-defined interfaces. This enables:
- Independent scaling of components
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Flexibility to swap implementations
- Clear separation of concerns

### 4. Contextual Intelligence
Leverage LLMs to understand not just what is said, but what it means:
- Extract daily topics and themes
- Extract  Entities, Platforms, Identifiers
- Categorize conversation content into predefind categories
- Identify discussion patterns
- Enable semantic search capabilities

### 5. Scalability Through Simplicity
Start with one group, design for many:
- Architecture supports multiple groups from day one
- Optimize for single group performance first
- Ensure database schema handles large volumes
- Keep complexity at the edges

### 6. Automation by Design
Human intervention should be minimal. The system must:
- Self-recover from common failures
- Handle rate limits and API constraints gracefully
- Automatically retry failed operations
- Alert only when human action is required

### 7. Incremental Processing
Avoid reprocessing data unnecessarily. The system should:
- Track what has been processed
- Support efficient incremental updates
- Enable selective reprocessing when needed
- Maintain processing checkpoints

### 8. Observability and Transparency
Every action should be traceable. We must:
- Log all significant operations
- Provide clear error messages
- Track processing metrics
- Enable debugging without code changes

### 9. Privacy and Compliance
Respect user privacy and data regulations:
- Process only authorized group data
- Implement data retention policies
- Support data anonymization where needed
- Maintain audit trails for compliance

### 10. Analytics That Matter
Focus on metrics that provide real value:
- User-level insights for individual analysis
- Group-level metrics for overall health
- Time-based patterns for optimization
- Contextual understanding for content strategy
- Foundation for future ML/demographic analysis

## Technical Approach

### Orchestration-First Design
We use Prefect as our workflow orchestration engine because:
- Production-grade reliability is non-negotiable
- Built-in observability reduces custom monitoring code
- Native retry and error handling simplifies our codebase
- Task dependencies are declarative and clear
- Parallel execution is handled elegantly

### Extract Once, Use Many Times
Raw data should be stored before transformation, allowing:
- Reprocessing with improved algorithms
- Multiple transformation strategies
- Historical data preservation
- Prefect's caching prevents unnecessary re-extraction

### Fail Fast, Recover Gracefully
- Validate early in the pipeline
- Provide clear failure reasons
- Leverage Prefect's automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Use Prefect's state handlers for complex recovery logic
- Ensure no partial updates corrupt data

### Configuration Over Code
- Externalize all settings
- Use Prefect's native parameter system
- Support environment-specific configs
- Enable runtime adjustments where safe
- Document all configuration options

### Testing as Documentation
- Tests demonstrate intended behavior
- Cover edge cases explicitly
- Use realistic test data
- Maintain test coverage metrics
- Test Prefect flows with mock data
