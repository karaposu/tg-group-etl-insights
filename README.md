ConvoETL is a Python package that extracts user conversations from any platform (Telegram groups, YouTube comments, Discord chats, etc.), loads them into your database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, BigQuery), and provides built-in analytics by transforming raw conversations into strategic community intelligence for product decisions, marketing targeting, and community management.
  

In short: Extract conversations → Store in database → Analyze user behavior

Key features:
- Multi-platform: One interface for all conversation sources
- Production-ready: Built on Prefect with retries, scheduling, monitoring
- Flexible storage: Write once, deploy to any database
- Built-in analytics: User profiling, sentiment analysis, topic extraction
- Simple API: pipeline.extract() → pipeline.load() → pipeline.analyze()

What ConvoETL Delivers 

  1. User-Centric Analytics

  - Individual Behavior Profiles: How each user communicates, their activity patterns, influence score
  - User Segmentation: Identify power users, lurkers, moderators, influencers, newcomers
  - Engagement Scoring: Who drives conversations vs who just reacts
  - Communication Style: Formal/casual, question-askers vs answer-givers, sentiment tendencies
  - User Journey Tracking: How users evolve from first message to active contributor

  2. Chat-Centric Analytics

  - Conversation Health Metrics: Response rates, thread depth, participation distribution
  - Topic Evolution: How discussions shift over time, emerging vs declining themes
  - Peak Activity Analysis: When your community is most active and why
  - Network Effects: Who talks to whom, conversation clusters, social graphs
  - Community Dynamics: Group sentiment trends, toxicity detection, moderator effectiveness

  3. Semantic Targeting

  - Interest Mapping: Automatically identify what topics each user cares about
  - Intent Detection: Distinguish questions, complaints, suggestions, praise
  - Audience Segmentation: Find users interested in specific products, features, or topics
  - Contextual Understanding: Beyond keywords - understand meaning and context
  - Targeting Recommendations: "Users who discussed X would be interested in Y"
