# Telegram Group ETL Insights Platform

## Overview
The Telegram Group ETL Insights Platform is an automated data pipeline system designed to extract, process, and analyze messages from Telegram groups at both group and individual user levels. It transforms unstructured conversation data into structured insights with deep user-level analytics and contextual understanding powered by LLMs.

## What We're Building
A comprehensive analytics platform that:
- Continuously monitors and extracts messages from a Telegram group (scalable to multiple groups)
- Processes and structures raw message data with user-level granularity
- Stores processed data in a queryable database with user profiles
- Generates actionable insights about both group dynamics and individual user behavior
- Analyzes conversation context and topics using LLM technology

## Core Functionality
1. **Automated Message Collection**: Scheduled extraction of messages with configurable frequency (hourly, daily, etc.)
2. **User-Centric Data Processing**: Parsing messages with attribution to individual users
3. **Persistent Storage**: Organized database with separate user and message tables
4. **Multi-Level Analytics**:
   - Group-level metrics (total messages, word counts, chat duration)
   - User-level metrics (messages per person, word distribution, activity patterns)
   - Contextual analysis using LLMs (topics discussed, conversation themes)
5. **Advanced User Profiling**: Future capability for demographic analysis and custom attributes

## Technical Architecture
The platform is built on **Prefect**, a modern workflow orchestration framework that provides:
- **Reliable Execution**: Built-in retry mechanisms and error handling
- **Observable Pipelines**: Real-time monitoring and logging dashboards
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Native support for hourly, daily, and custom schedules
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficient user-level concurrent data processing
- **State Management**: Checkpoint and recovery capabilities for large data volumes

## Key Metrics Tracked
### Message Analysis
- Total message count
- Total word count
- Total character count
- Chat duration in days

### Participant-Specific Metrics
- Individual message counts
- Word distribution per user
- Top 10 most frequent words per user
- Activity patterns per participant

### General Statistics
- Average message length
- Average words per message
- Average characters per message

### Time-Based Analysis
- Hourly activity patterns
- Weekly activity patterns
- Most active days identification

### Contextual Analysis (LLM-powered)
- Daily topic extraction
- Conversation theme identification
- Content categorization

## Target Use Cases
- **Individual User Analysis**: Deep dive into each participant's communication style and patterns
- **Group Dynamics**: Understanding overall chat activity and engagement
- **Content Intelligence**: What topics are being discussed and when
- **Behavioral Insights**: User-level patterns for future demographic analysis
- **Time-Based Optimization**: Finding optimal engagement windows

## Expected Benefits
- Granular user-level insights
- Contextual understanding of conversations
- Scalable architecture for multiple groups
- Foundation for advanced user profiling
- Data-driven decision making at both group and individual levels

## Success Metrics
- Accurate user attribution for all messages
- Comprehensive metric calculation at user and group levels
- Successful topic extraction using LLMs
- Scalable performance with large message volumes
- Easy access to both aggregated and individual analytics
